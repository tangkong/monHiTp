    -Created Version History
    -Edited criteria for FSDP choice
    -Optimized basin hopping iteration for background fitting
    -Implemented integration limits in image dimension reduction

2018.04.27
    -Modified thresholding for FSDP, using absolute peak location rather
        than fit peak location to filter
    -Passing background config info through to peakBBA
    -heatmap scan labeling, resizing.  Now saving keyMap, with scan numbers labeled
    -set spline smoothing to default (works nicely) rather than every point for litFWHM





Usage notes:
    * When restricting integration limits in Q, consider using poly fit rather than chevbyshev.  Using Cheb for single peaks will over-fit backgrounds.  
    * inputting "pass" or any text in Q-chi limits will cause script to not take any integration bounds
