    -Created Version History
    -Edited criteria for FSDP choice
    -Optimized basin hopping iteration for background fitting
    -Implemented integration limits in image dimension reduction

2018.04.27
    -Modified thresholding for FSDP, using absolute peak location rather
        than fit peak location to filter
    -Passing background config info through to peakBBA
    -heatmap scan labeling, resizing.  Now saving keyMap, with scan numbers labeled
    -set spline smoothing to default (works nicely) rather than every point for litFWHM

2018.05.04
    -Modified integration bounds to only apply to 1D.  2D always fully integrates.  
        csv now reflects bounds.
    -Best to use cheby for q restriction, but must keep q range long.
    -Added skip existing 1D csvs for speeding up runs
    -Cleaned wafer heat map

    To-Do: 
        + Look at possibly merging blocks, dealing with peaks with multiple curves w/in
        + Look into making single file processing script 

2018.05.11
    -Implemented fitting with variable number of curves, using error to determine halt
    -Limited location of peaks to within peak, to prevent confusion when selecting FSDP
    -Fixed cheb bkgd to pin at ends of data, nice results

2018.05.18
    -Modified peak selection algo for feature extraction to incorp yMax data 
        (interpreting curves).  
    -Implemented control for var vs set number of peaks in config files
    -Imp minimum yMax for peak selection

2018.05.25
    -Started documenting 

Usage notes:
    * When restricting integration limits in Q, consider using poly fit rather than chevbyshev.  Using Cheb for single peaks will over-fit backgrounds.  
    * inputting "pass" or any text in Q-chi limits will cause script to not take any integration bounds

To-Do:
-Check compatibility with other detector image types
